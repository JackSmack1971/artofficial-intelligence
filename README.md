# ArtOfficial Intelligence

This repository contains the source code for **ArtOfficial Intelligence**, an AI-focused news platform built with React, TypeScript, Vite and Tailwind CSS. The project aims to aggregate and present the latest developments in artificial intelligence.

For detailed development guidelines—including directory structure, design standards and security requirements—see [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) in the project root. Additional `AGENTS.md` files throughout the repository provide context for each subdirectory.

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies with `pnpm install` (Node.js 18+ is required).
2. Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` and add your API keys.
3. Start the development server with `pnpm dev`.

Testing and build steps are described in the root `AGENTS.md` file.
